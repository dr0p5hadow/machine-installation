# machine-installation
The base idea and script for this repository is taken from https://github.com/nahamsec
This script is using the BBHT and the recon_profile repositories (no need to install any one of them, they are both in this repository)
This install process will also add (except the BBHT scripts).
1. Postman
2. Pycharm
3. OWASP ZAP
4. Visual Studio Code
5. Cacher
6. Amass

> All AWS processes removed from those scripts, i am just not using AWS so much ðŸ˜‡
